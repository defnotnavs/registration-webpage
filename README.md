## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Registration Webpage** created as part of the *DOM and Events Activity* in Web Development.  
It demonstrates my understanding of:

- ✅ HTML for webpage structure  
- ✅ CSS for styling and theme switching (Light & Dark mode)  
- ✅ JavaScript for:
  - DOM manipulation  
  - Event handling (bubbling and capturing)  
  - Form validation (username, email, password)  
  - Dynamic feedback messages  

The webpage allows users to:
- Enter a username, email, and password  
- Get instant feedback if the input is valid or invalid  
- Switch between light and dark mode  
- See event bubbling and capturing in action

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `reg_web.html` in any modern browser  
3. Try:
   - Filling out the registration form  
   - Switching between light/dark themes  
   - Clicking the “Click Me” button to test bubbling/capturing
